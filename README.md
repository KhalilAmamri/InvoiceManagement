## 📋 Prerequisites
- **Windows OS** with .NET Framework 4.5 or higher installed.
- **Visual Studio**: Recommended for opening and building the project (Community edition is free).
- **SQL Server**: For database setup (e.g., SQL Server Express).
- **Git**: For version control and cloning the repository.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/InvoiceManagement.git
   cd InvoiceManagement
   ```
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Configure the database connection (update connection string in `connect_db.cs` if applicable).
4. Build and run the solution.

### Database Setup
- Create a new database in SQL Server (e.g., `InvoiceDB`).
- Execute the following SQL script to create a basic table:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Invoices (
      InvoiceID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
      InvoiceNumber VARCHAR(50),
      ClientName VARCHAR(100),
      Amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
      IssueDate DATE
  );
  ```
- Update the connection string in your code to point to this database.

### Running the Application
- Open `main.cs` or the startup form in Visual Studio.
- Press F5 to build and run.
